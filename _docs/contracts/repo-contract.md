# Unstructure Repository Contract

## Ownership

This repository owns document parsing, chunking, and unstructured processing
scripts for TianGong AI source domains, including ESG, education, journals,
patents, reports, standards, textbooks, and related vector/index preparation
flows.

## Boundaries

- API serving belongs in the edge-function repository unless the change is a
  local processing script here.
- MCP client-facing tool schemas belong in the MCP repository.
- Root workspace governance, branch policy, and submodule integration remain in
  the workspace repository.
- Large input documents, processed outputs, and job logs are operational data,
  not source documentation.

## Processing Surface

Scripts under `src/**`, dependency facts in `requirements.txt`, and local stack
files under `docker/**` define processing behavior. Changes to input formats,
output locations, chunking logic, embedding/index targets, OCR dependencies, or
long-running job commands require review of:

- `README.md`
- `_docs/architecture/repo-architecture.md`
- `_docs/runbooks/development.md`

## Completion Criteria

- Run `docpact route` before editing governed files.
- Run `docpact validate-config --root . --strict` after governance changes.
- For script changes, run the smallest representative script or import/syntax
  smoke check available for the touched domain.
- Do not leave dependency, data-flow, or validation facts only in chat.
