# Unstructure Architecture

## Overview

The repository contains Python workflows for converting heterogeneous source
documents into structured chunks and index-ready artifacts for TianGong AI.
Workflows are organized by source domain under `src/**`.

## Key Paths

- `src/{ali,education,edu_textbooks,esg,journals,patents,pptx,reports,standards}/**`:
  source-domain processing scripts.
- `src/kb_parse_worker/**`: KB F03 parse and S3-ready workers. The parse
  worker consumes `kb_parse_queue`, claims jobs through the KB control plane,
  calls Unstructure-Serve, publishes processed artifacts to NAS, and enqueues
  the S3-ready check. The S3-ready worker consumes `kb_s3_ready_queue` and
  marks processed artifacts ready after S3 verification.
- `ecosystem.kb_parse_worker.json`: PM2 process definitions for the KB parse
  worker and S3-ready worker.
- `src/journals/**`: journal workflows; also read `src/journals/AGENTS.md`.
- `src/tools/**` and per-domain `tools/**`: helper modules.
- `src/weaviate/**`: local Weaviate utility scripts.
- `src/legacy/**`: legacy experiments and migration references; verify before reuse.
- `docker/weaviate/*.yml`: local Weaviate stacks.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependency facts.

## Runtime Shape

The repository expects Python virtual environments and native document tooling
such as poppler, libreoffice, pandoc, tesseract, and CUDA-capable optional
components for some workloads. Treat README command dumps as legacy notes unless
the referenced files still exist.

## Integration Points

- Output artifacts feed downstream knowledge-base and search/index services.
- The KB parse worker reads raw document locations from `kb_documents.raw_uri`,
  requires raw files to live under the collection-derived storage path using
  the renamed canonical filename `{document_id}{file_ext}`, writes processed
  `jsonl`/`pkl`/`txt`/`manifest.json` artifacts under the configured NAS
  processed root using a `_pickle` suffixed path derived from the collection
  storage path, and calls `complete_parse_local_ready_and_enqueue_s3_check(...)`.
  The worker requests `return_txt=true` from Unstructure-Serve, drops parser
  chunks whose `text` is empty before embedding, and writes the returned
  whole-document text as `{artifact_uuid}.txt` beside the pickle artifact.
  Before artifact writes, the worker embeds every remaining chunk `text` field
  through the OpenAI-compatible Qwen3-Embedding-8B endpoint, locally truncates
  and normalizes vectors to 1536 dimensions, stores vectors in the pickle chunks
  under `embedding`, and excludes `embedding` from the JSONL artifact.
  That RPC completes the parse job, leaves the document in `s3_sync_pending`,
  and enqueues a durable `s3_ready` job. The parse worker treats that final
  local-ready RPC plus parse-message archive as one finalization step. A parse
  finalization reconciler can repair historical splits where deterministic
  processed artifacts already exist on NAS but the final DB handoff did not
  commit; it validates the local manifest identity and replays the local-ready
  DB transition without re-running document parsing. A
  separate S3-ready worker then verifies the processed manifest/jsonl/pkl/txt
  objects after NAS-to-S3 sync and calls `complete_s3_ready_check(...)` to mark
  `processed_s3_ready`. Final DB transitions and failure writes retry transient
  Postgres connection failures with short reconnecting backoff. PM2 keeps
  both long-running worker processes resident; each worker's heartbeat loop
  keeps its active job lock and PGMQ visibility timeout fresh. Parse and
  S3-ready jobs also enforce worker-local hard timeouts, consume typed
  `claim_job_from_pgmq_message(...)` dispositions, classify failures as
  retryable or terminal before calling `fail_job_v2(...)`, and archive the
  current PGMQ message by queue/message id only when the control plane contract
  says the current wake-up should be removed. Retryable failures archive the
  current transport message after `fail_job_v2(...)` schedules the delayed
  retry wake-up.
- Edge functions query indexes or storage populated by these workflows, but API
  serving remains outside this repository.
